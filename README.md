1. Include the CSV files in the same directory as the "loader.py" and "query.py" files.
2. Run "loader.py" first to create and load the tables.
3. Then run "query.py" which will output the results for each query.

loaderEC.py is the extra credit loader. It seems to work, it just takes too
 long of a time to insert the files within a reasonable timeframe. It
prints every 1000 insertions to show that it does insert, but waiting 
for it would take too long.
